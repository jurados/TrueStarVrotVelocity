# Distribution of True Stellar Rotational Velocities

This project contains code and data to analyze and visualize the distribution of true stellar rotational velocities (v) based on observed projected rotational velocities (v sin i).

## Abstract



## Results

## Conclusions
- In the cases of Field Stars the value of $\alpha = 0$ was obtianed, indicating that the distribution of true rotational velocities is consistent with an isotropic distribution of stellar rotation axes. This result aligns with previous studies such as Chandrasekhar & Münch (1950).

- In the case of Star Cluster members, a value of $\alpha \neq 0.5$ was obtained, suggesting a non-isotropic distribution of stellar rotation axes. This finding is consistent with the results reported by Corsaro E. et al. (2017) and Solar M. (2021), who found evidence of spin alignment in stars within old open clusters.
